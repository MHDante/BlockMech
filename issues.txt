BlockIt issues:
-move pieces in the editor around
-fix teleporting issues for blocking teleporters
-make doors colored walls instead
-make visual item for pushing blocks through walls
-make open-door graphic, and allow users to put down open doors (that close when button pressed)
-expand allowed colors
-fix issue where doors at very top row don't function
    


Done:
Switches are time-dependent, they should activate immediately
